
## Opening an environment

### From GitHub

To open an environment from GitHub, you must type in the `organization/repository` string into the text box. For example, if your repository is at `https://github.com/Yogstation13/Yogstation` you would type in `Yogstation13/Yogstation`. After that you hit Open GitHub Repository. You will be presented with the option to select a branch. An individual commit can be typed into the dropdown if desired. Up to 256 MiB worth of files will be stored in a cache to reduce the amount of files that need to be downloaded.

### From the disk

Depending on your browser, there will either be an Open Local Workspace button, or a Browse... button. To open an environment, use this and select the directory containing your project.

## Editing a map

### The object tree

To the left is the object tree. It includes all of the objects types which can be placed in a map. The visibility of an object type can be toggled using the eye icon to the left of it. The hotkeys Alt-1 through Alt-4 toggle visibility for `/area`, `/mob`, `/obj`, and `/turf` respectively.

Under the object tree is a search bar. It can be focused using Ctrl-F. Typing into it will filter the objects displayed in the object tree. After typing in a search query, the up and down arrow keys can be used to select an object, and then Enter can be pressed to go back to the object tree view.

### Tools

There are four tools available: the Placement tool, the Drag tool, the Pipe Placement tool, and the Select tool. Hovering over their icons shows a description of how to use them.

## Using offline

Opening FastDMM2 will automatically install a service worker. This will allow you to go to the url and use the editor even when offline.
